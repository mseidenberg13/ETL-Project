# ETL-Project

In this project the goal is to extract data from a source, transform that data, and then load the data into a database.

Used csv files from Kaggle as my data. This included data on housing prices, income, restaurants, and population.

Extracted that data into a Pandas dataframe, then cleaned it and transformed it into the exact dataframes that were going to be loaded. Then Loaded the dataframes into PostgreSQL.

In this project technologies used were, Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy.
